### Building with Effect Compilation

VectorRumble includes shader effects that require compilation. The project uses GitHub workflows to automatically set up the required dependencies (.NET 9 and Wine) for CoPilot environments.

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Running Tests

VectorRumble includes comprehensive unit tests to help prevent bugs. To run the test suite:

```bash
dotnet test VectorRumble.Tests/VectorRumble.Tests.csproj
```

The test suite covers:
- Utility functions (Helper class)
- Mathematical collision detection (Collision class)
- Custom collection types (CollectCollection)

All tests are isolated and don't require graphics context or audio hardware.
